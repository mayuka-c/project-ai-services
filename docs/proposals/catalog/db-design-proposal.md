## Database Selection

### Considerations

We evaluated the following database options:

- **PostgreSQL** - Relational Database
- **MongoDB** - NoSQL Document-based Database  
- **Redis** - In-memory cache (primarily for caching frequent data, can be used for persistence but not recommended as best practice)

### Decision: PostgreSQL

We have chosen **PostgreSQL** as our database for the following reasons:

1. **Relational Model Fit**: The Catalog service has clear relationships between Deployable Architectures, Services, and Infrastructure components, which perfectly models the relational SQL structure with tables.

2. **Future Integration**: In upcoming releases, if we adopt Keycloak as our Identity Provider and Identity Access Management tool, we can reuse the same PostgreSQL instance. This approach avoids maintaining multiple database instances.

3. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL provides strong consistency guarantees essential for catalog management.

4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Infrastructure and Services are distinct bounded contexts with different lifecycles, ownership, and scaling patterns.

## Relationships

1. **Applications → Services**: One-to-Many
   - One application can have multiple services
   - Services reference their parent application via app_name
   - app_name is used as the foreign key for natural relationship

2. **Services ↔ Infrastructure**: Many-to-Many
   - Services can use multiple infrastructure components
   - Infrastructure components can be shared across multiple services
   - Implemented via the `services_infra` junction table

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Natural Primary Key for Applications
The applications table uses `app_name` as the primary key:
- **Natural Identifier**: app_name is already unique and immutable
- **Meaningful References**: Foreign keys use app_name instead of UUID
- **Simpler Queries**: No need to join to get application name
- **Consistent Naming**: Used for pod/namespace prefixes in deployments
- **No UUID Overhead**: Eliminates unnecessary UUID generation and storage

### 2. UUID Primary Keys for Other Tables
Services and infrastructure tables use UUID as primary keys for:
- Global uniqueness
- Better distribution in distributed systems
- Security (non-sequential IDs)

### 3. Custom Types
PostgreSQL custom types (ENUM) are used for:
- **deployment_type**: Ensures only valid deployment types for applications
- **status**: Standardizes status values across tables (includes Deleting for cleanup workflows)

### 4. Application Type Field
The type field in applications table stores:
- **Application Type**: Digital Assistant, Summarization, etc.
- **Direct Classification**: No separate architectures table needed
- **Simpler Schema**: Reduces table count from 6 to 5 tables
- **Clear Semantics**: Type directly describes what the application does

### 6. Separate Infrastructure Table
Infrastructure is separated from services for:
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Different lifecycles, ownership, and scaling patterns
- **Strong Type Safety**: Foreign keys enforce referential integrity
- **Reusability**: Infrastructure can be shared across multiple services
- **Independent Lifecycle**: Infrastructure can exist independently of services
- **Cost Optimization**: Avoid duplicate infrastructure provisioning

### 7. Many-to-Many Relationship
The `services_infra` junction table enables:
- Multiple services to share the same infrastructure (e.g., multiple services using one vector store)
- Services to depend on multiple infrastructure components
- Clean separation between service and infrastructure lifecycles
- Easy querying of dependencies in both directions

### 8. Consistent Field Sizing
- VARCHAR(100) for type fields across applications, services and infra tables
- Provides sufficient length for descriptive type names
- Consistent sizing across similar fields

### 9. Timestamps
All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` with `TIMESTAMPTZ` for:
- Complete audit trail
- Time-zone aware timestamps
- Automatic timestamp generation and updates
- Tracking both creation and modification times

### 10. Immutable Primary Key
The `app_name` field serves as both identifier and primary key:
- Immutable to ensure consistent pod naming in Podman
- Stable namespace naming in OpenShift
- Natural referential integrity in deployed resources
- Prevents accidental renames that would break deployments

## Migration Strategy

1. Create custom types first:
   - deployment_type
   - status

2. Create tables in dependency order:
   - users
   - applications (with app_name as PK)
   - services (with app_name FK)
   - infra
   - services_infra (junction table)

3. Add indexes for:
   - Foreign keys (app_name in services, service_id, infra_id)
   - Frequently queried columns (type, status)
   - app_name is already indexed as primary key

4. Set up appropriate constraints and triggers for:
   - Automatic updated_at timestamp updates
   - Cascading deletes where appropriate
   - Check constraints for valid data

## Common Queries

### 1. Get all applications:
```sql
SELECT * FROM applications ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### 2. Get application with services and infrastructure:
```sql
SELECT
    a.*,
    s.id as service_id, s.type as service_type, s.version as service_version,
    s.endpoints as service_endpoints,
    i.id as infra_id, i.type as infra_type, i.status as infra_status,
    i.endpoints as infra_endpoints
FROM applications a
LEFT JOIN services s ON a.app_name = s.app_name
LEFT JOIN services_infra si ON s.id = si.service_id
LEFT JOIN infra i ON si.infra_id = i.id
WHERE a.app_name = 'my-app';
```

### 3. Get all services for an application:
```sql
SELECT * FROM services
WHERE app_name = 'my-app'
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### 4. Get shared infrastructure usage:
```sql
SELECT
    i.*,
    COUNT(DISTINCT si.service_id) as service_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.app_name) as application_count
FROM infra i
LEFT JOIN services_infra si ON i.id = si.infra_id
LEFT JOIN services s ON si.service_id = s.id
GROUP BY i.id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT si.service_id) > 1;
```

### 5. Get application by app_name (direct lookup):
```sql
SELECT * FROM applications WHERE app_name = 'my-app';
```

### 6. Get applications by type:
```sql
SELECT * FROM applications WHERE type = 'Digital Assistant';
```

## Alternative Design: Unified Services Table

### Overview
This alternative approach combines the `services`, `infra`, and `services_infra` tables into a single unified `services` table. This section documents this approach and compares its limitations with the recommended separate infrastructure design.

### Alternative Services Table

**Table Name:** `services`

| Column Name         | Data Type         | Constraints | Description |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| id                  | UUID              | PRIMARY KEY | Unique service identifier |
| app_name            | VARCHAR(100)      | FOREIGN KEY | References applications(app_name) |
| type                | VARCHAR(100)      |             | Service/Infrastructure type |
| category            | service_category  | ENUM        | Service category (Application Service, Infrastructure) |
| status              | Status            | ENUM        | Current status (Deploying, Running, Deleting, Error) |
| created_at          | TIMESTAMPTZ       | DEFAULT NOW() | Timestamp of creation |
| updated_at          | TIMESTAMPTZ       | DEFAULT NOW() | Timestamp of last update |
| version             | TEXT              |             | Service/Infrastructure version |
| properties          | JSONB             |             | Additional properties (endpoints, models, credentials) |
| infrastructure_deps | JSONB             |             | Array of infrastructure service dependencies |

**Custom Type:**
```sql
CREATE TYPE service_category AS ENUM (
    'Application Service',
    'Infrastructure'
);
```

**Infrastructure Dependencies JSONB Structure:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "service_id": "uuid-of-vector-store",
      "type": "vector_store",
      "required": true
    },
    {
      "service_id": "uuid-of-inference-backend",
      "type": "inference_backend",
      "required": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Comparison: Separate vs Unified Design

| Aspect | Separate Infrastructure (Recommended) | Unified Services (Alternative) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Schema Complexity** | 5 tables (users, applications, services, infra, services_infra) | 3 tables (users, applications, services) |
| **Type Safety** | ✅ Strong - Foreign keys enforce relationships | ⚠️ Weak - JSONB dependencies, no FK enforcement |
| **Data Integrity** | ✅ Database-level referential integrity | ⚠️ Application-level validation required |
| **Query Performance** | ✅ Indexed foreign keys, efficient joins | ⚠️ JSONB queries slower, GIN indexes needed |
| **Lifecycle Management** | ✅ Independent infrastructure lifecycle | ❌ Mixed lifecycle complicates management |
| **Infrastructure Reusability** | ✅ Explicit many-to-many via junction table | ⚠️ Implicit via JSONB, harder to query |
| **Separation of Concerns** | ✅ Clear domain boundaries | ❌ Mixed concerns in single table |
| **Schema Evolution** | ⚠️ Requires migrations for new fields | ✅ JSONB allows flexible schema |
| **Orphaned Records** | ✅ Prevented by foreign keys | ❌ Possible if JSONB references deleted services |
| **Circular Dependencies** | ✅ Can be prevented at DB level | ❌ Must be checked in application code |
| **Finding Shared Infra** | ✅ Simple COUNT query on junction table | ⚠️ Complex JSONB aggregation queries |
| **Dependency Queries** | ✅ Standard SQL joins | ⚠️ JSONB path queries with LATERAL joins |
| **Infrastructure Catalog** | ✅ Easy to build separate catalog | ⚠️ Requires filtering by category |
| **Backup/Restore** | ✅ Can backup infrastructure separately | ⚠️ All-or-nothing approach |
| **Access Control** | ✅ Can set different permissions per table | ⚠️ Same permissions for all service types |
| **Monitoring** | ✅ Separate metrics for services vs infra | ⚠️ Requires category-based filtering |

### Limitations of Unified Design

#### 1. **No Infrastructure Reusability (Critical Limitation)**
The 1:1 relationship via `parent_service_id` means:
- **Each infrastructure can only be bound to ONE service**
- Cannot share a vector database across multiple services
- Cannot share an inference model across multiple applications
- Must provision duplicate infrastructure for each service that needs it

**Real-world Impact:**
```
Service A (Summarization) → Vector DB Instance 1
Service B (Digitization)  → Vector DB Instance 2  (Duplicate!)
Service C (Chat Bot)      → Vector DB Instance 3  (Duplicate!)
```

Instead of:
```
Service A (Summarization) ─┐
Service B (Digitization)  ├─→ Shared Vector DB Instance
Service C (Chat Bot)      ─┘
```

#### 2. **Cannot Leverage Existing Customer Infrastructure**
Many customers already have:
- Existing vector databases (OpenSearch, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Running inference models/endpoints
- Established ML infrastructure

**Problems:**
- Cannot reference pre-existing infrastructure in the catalog
- Forces customers to provision new infrastructure even when they have suitable ones
- No way to "bring your own infrastructure" (BYOI)
- Increases costs and deployment complexity

#### 3. **Poor UI/UX for Infrastructure Selection**
The 1:1 model prevents building user-friendly interfaces:

**Cannot implement:**
- Dropdown to select from available vector databases
- List of running inference models to choose from
- Infrastructure marketplace/catalog
- "Use existing" vs "Create new" infrastructure options

**UI Flow Limitation:**
```
❌ Cannot do this:
1. User creates a service
2. UI shows: "Select Vector Database"
   - [Existing VDB 1] ← Already running
   - [Existing VDB 2] ← Already running
   - [Create New VDB]
3. User selects existing VDB

✅ Forced to do this:
1. User creates a service
2. System automatically creates new dedicated infrastructure
3. No choice, no reuse
```

#### 4. **Weak Referential Integrity**
```sql
-- In unified design with JSONB dependencies, this can happen:
DELETE FROM services WHERE id = 'infra-uuid';
-- Other services still reference this in their infrastructure_deps JSONB
-- No database error, creates orphaned references
```

#### 5. **Complex Dependency Queries**
```sql
-- Finding all services using an infrastructure requires complex JSONB queries:
SELECT s.*
FROM services s
CROSS JOIN LATERAL jsonb_array_elements(s.infrastructure_deps->'dependencies') AS dep
WHERE (dep->>'service_id')::uuid = 'infra-uuid';

-- vs. simple join in separate design:
SELECT s.* FROM services s
JOIN services_infra si ON s.id = si.service_id
WHERE si.infra_id = 'infra-uuid';
```

#### 6. **Resource Waste and Cost Implications**
- **Duplicate Infrastructure**: Each service gets its own infrastructure
- **Higher Costs**: 10 services = 10 vector DBs instead of 1 shared
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Underutilized infrastructure instances
- **Operational Overhead**: Managing many small instances vs few large ones

**Cost Example:**
```
Separate Design:
- 1 Shared Vector DB: $500/month
- 10 Services using it: $500/month total

Unified Design:
- 10 Dedicated Vector DBs: $500 × 10 = $5,000/month
- 10x cost increase!
```

#### 7. **Mixed Lifecycle Management**
- Infrastructure typically has longer lifecycle than application services
- Upgrades, backups, and monitoring become more complex
- Cannot easily separate infrastructure operations from service operations
- Deleting a service forces deletion of its infrastructure (even if others could use it)

#### 8. **No Database-Level Validation for JSONB Dependencies**
- Cannot enforce that infrastructure_deps references valid service IDs
- Cannot prevent circular dependencies at database level
- Must implement all validation in application code
- Risk of data inconsistency

#### 9. **Scalability Concerns**
- Cannot scale infrastructure independently from services
- Cannot implement infrastructure pooling or load balancing
- Difficult to implement multi-tenancy for infrastructure
- No way to track infrastructure utilization across services

#### 10. **Enterprise Requirements Not Met**
Enterprise customers typically need:
- **Infrastructure Catalog**: Browse and select from approved infrastructure
- **Cost Allocation**: Track which services use which infrastructure
- **Compliance**: Ensure services use certified/approved infrastructure
- **Governance**: Control which infrastructure can be used
- **Chargeback**: Bill teams based on infrastructure usage

The unified design makes these requirements difficult or impossible to implement.

### When to Consider Unified Design

The unified design might be acceptable if:
- Infrastructure is rarely shared across services (1:1 relationship)
- Application is small-scale with limited infrastructure
- Schema flexibility is more important than data integrity
- Team prefers simpler schema over stronger guarantees
- Infrastructure lifecycle matches service lifecycle

### Recommendation

**Use the separate infrastructure design** (recommended in this proposal) because:
1. Infrastructure and services have fundamentally different lifecycles
2. Database-level integrity prevents data corruption
3. Better performance for relationship queries
4. Aligns with industry patterns (Kubernetes, cloud providers)
5. Easier to scale and maintain long-term
6. Supports future features like infrastructure marketplace

The additional complexity of 2 extra tables is justified by the significant benefits in data integrity, performance, and maintainability.

## Future Considerations

1. **Keycloak Integration**: Schema can be extended to integrate with Keycloak's user management
2. **Audit Logging**: Consider adding `updated_at` and `updated_by` columns
3. **Soft Deletes**: May add `deleted_at` column for soft delete functionality
4. **Indexing Strategy**: Create indexes based on query patterns as they emerge
5. **Partitioning**: Consider table partitioning for large-scale deployments
7. **Dependency Validation**: Add application-level validation for infrastructure dependencies
8. **Infrastructure Versioning**: Track infrastructure version compatibility with services

## Conclusion

This database design provides a solid foundation for the Catalog service with:
- Clear relational structure with proper separation of concerns
- Strong data integrity through foreign key constraints
- Efficient querying capabilities with proper indexing
- Scalability for growth and infrastructure sharing
- Alignment with industry best practices and cloud-native patterns
- Flexibility for future enhancements through JSONB properties
- Support for complex service-infrastructure relationships (if we want to seperate it out)
